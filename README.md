# Python
Welcome to my AI learning journey! This repo will contain all the Python notebooks, mini-projects, and learning materials I create as I grow in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
AI learning journey from basics to advanced (Python, ML, DL, TensorFlow)

## 📘 Notebooks Included

- `ai_world.ipynb` – My first notebook with NumPy, Matplotlib, and Python basics
- `data_analysis.ipynb` – Coming soon: Pandas and data visualization

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter (via VS Code)
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Manual GitHub uploads

## 💡 About Me

I am transitioning into AI from a Zoology background.  
This GitHub is part of my portfolio for jobs, internships, and scholarships.

## ✅ Projects

### 1. NumPy + Matplotlib Introduction
📄 `01_numpy_intro_plot.ipynb`  
- ✔️ Used NumPy for array operations
- ✔️ Created a basic plot using Matplotlib
- ✔️ First hands-on AI-related notebook

---

## 🚀 Tools I'm Using
- Python + Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebooks (in VS Code)
- Pylint for clean code
- GitHub for version control

---

## 📅 Next Steps
- 🧠 Learn Scikit-learn & build ML models
- 🐍 Explore TensorFlow and Keras
- 🤖 Start mini-projects (e.g. animal classifier, chatbot)
- 🎓 Earn certificates (Coursera, IBM, FastAI, CS50x)
